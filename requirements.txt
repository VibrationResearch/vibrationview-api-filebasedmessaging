# VibrationVIEW Client Requirements
# 
# This application uses only Python standard library modules.
# No additional packages need to be installed via pip.
#
# Standard library modules used:
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - winreg (Windows registry access) 
# - os (operating system interface)
# - sys (system-specific parameters)
# - time (time-related functions)
# - subprocess (subprocess management)
# - threading (thread-based parallelism)
# - pathlib (object-oriented filesystem paths)
# - datetime (date and time handling)
# - json (JSON encoder/decoder)
# - stat (file statistics - for future permission handling)
#
# Python version requirement:
# python>=3.6
#
# Platform requirement:
# Windows (due to winreg dependency and VibrationVIEW software)
#
# Note: If you need to install Python, download from https://python.org
# Ensure tkinter is included (it's included by default in most Python installations)
